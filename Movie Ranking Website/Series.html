        <h1>Best TV Series</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p class="about-page">
            Here we are going to look at the best television series of all time (according to me of course). Almost all
            genres will be covered; such as comedy, action, romance, documentaries, fiction, anime and varius mixtures
            of these genres.
            <br>
            Those who haven't watched any of these are advised to hop onto them ASAP, you won't regret it.
            <br>
            So let's just get straight into it :)

            <h3 class="titles">The Office</h3>
            <p class="description">
                This is definitely one of the top comedy shows of all time!!!. You cannot finish an episode without
                laughing. Well tbh you can't even go 5 minutes without a couple of knee slaps.
                Steve Carell plays Michael Scott as the region manager of a paper company in a small town.
                He is quite the odd leader but always has good intentions at heart even though he does and says the
                dumbest stuu sometimes.
                Everyone in that office is unique and brings all sorts of comedy into the picture. It's always something
                new there.
                The storyline is not really solid since its a sitcom, but it all adds up as the seasons progress.<br>
                if you aren't careful you could spend the whole day watching this show lol.

                "WINTER IS COMING!"<br>
                Mannnn this show is top tier. Set in medieval times, it's the perfect combination of fantasy, history,
                gore, royal politics and adventure.
                The storyline is beautiful, every single character plays a role in making this one of the Greatest Of
                All Time (it already has G, O and T in it).
                Story arcs, plot twists, unique character development, beatiful scenary and monuments; this will all
                leave you at the edge of your seat every time.
                But one thing you would not expect is how amazing the special effects are. It's like they could not get
                anything wrong when making this show.<br>
