    <main>
        <p class="about-page">
            Here we are going to look at the best television series of all time (according to me of course). Almost all
            genres will be covered; such as comedy, action, romance, documentaries, fiction, anime and varius mixtures
            of these genres.
            <br>
            Those who haven't watched any of these are advised to hop onto them ASAP, you won't regret it.
            <br>
            So let's just get straight into it :)
        </p>

            <h3 class="titles">The Office</h3>
            <p class="description">
                This is definitely one of the top comedy shows of all time!!!. You cannot finish an episode without
                laughing. Well tbh you can't even go 5 minutes without a couple of knee slaps.
                Steve Carell plays Michael Scott as the region manager of a paper company in a small town.
                He is quite the odd leader but always has good intentions at heart even though he does and says the
                dumbest stuu sometimes.
                Everyone in that office is unique and brings all sorts of comedy into the picture. It's always something
                new there.
                The storyline is not really solid since its a sitcom, but it all adds up as the seasons progress.<br>
                if you aren't careful you could spend the whole day watching this show lol.

                "WINTER IS COMING!"<br>
                Mannnn this show is top tier. Set in medieval times, it's the perfect combination of fantasy, history,
                gore, royal politics and adventure.
                The storyline is beautiful, every single character plays a role in making this one of the Greatest Of
                All Time (it already has G, O and T in it).
                Story arcs, plot twists, unique character development, beatiful scenary and monuments; this will all
                leave you at the edge of your seat every time.
                But one thing you would not expect is how amazing the special effects are. It's like they could not get
                anything wrong when making this show.<br>

            <p class="description">
                This show makes you look at drug dealing from a whole new perspective. The drama, romance, violence, criminal tactics and captivating 
                storyline will have you at the edge of your seat most of the time. You will definitely feel like becoming a drug dealer the momment you start watching this.
                Each character is essential in the story but ultimately the main characters are Ghost and Tommy, that classic story of bestfriends who made it to the top
                together through thick and thin. But, as you would expect, one wants to leave the game or go legit and the other still wants to get that paper. And that's when all
                the problems beigin.
                It is definitely as must watch.

                "I'm the one who knocks on the door"<br>
                Walter White is undeniably one of the best characters in the fictional drug dealing universe. His Character development is amazing. From being a bum to becoming the most 
                skilled and diabolical meth cook on both sides of the border.<br>
                Walter is a middle classchemistry gets diagonosed with cancer and ,just like most terminally ill people, finds out that his days on earth are numbered. So he decides to team up
                with an old student of his and uses his knowledge of chemistry to produce the most pure meth so he can leave his family with enough money when he leaves. It starts of as a one time 
                thing, purely harmless, but it goes on for some time. And as time goes Walter goes from being an innocent man to becoming a cold hearted criminal who uses uses his knowledge ofchemistry
                to commit the most horrendous crimes ever.<br>
                A whole new approach to drug dealing and story telling. You will obviously find drama violence, but not as you are used to seeing it. You won't regret watching this show!

            <h3 class="titles">How I Met Your Mother</h3>
            <p class="description">
                In this sitcom Ted (the simp in the group) tells his kids a very long and detailed story about how he met their mother. 
                He also tells stories of the crazy adventures and situations that he experienced
                with his amazing group of friends. Barny, Robin (hard on the outside but a big softy on the inside), Lily and Marshall (your typical power couple). All of them are so unique in a good, weird and funny way. 
                In my own opinion Barny is the best character, your typical white playboy but with the most interesting "playbook" ever.<br>
                Amazing moments and one of the few shows that shows how important the bro code is.<br>
                Everything about the show is very amazing. and the ending will leave you quite shocked.
