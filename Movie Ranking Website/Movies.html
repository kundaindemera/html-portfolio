        <p class="about-page">This list is based on my taste in movie, the movies are from different genres so they
            won't be in any particular
            order. It obviously won't be in order because ranking them is so difficult since each movie has different
            charecteristics that could contribute to it being at the top.<br />Hope you try out a few for
            yourself.<br />LET'S GET INTO IT!!!!<br />

            <p class="description">
                Most people only know this movie because of the nudity, drugs, crazinnes and the
                beautiful Margot Robbie. But
                it's a really beautiful true life story about investing and going from rags to riches

            <p class="description">
                Now this movie is AMAZING. The actors, directors, special effects and story line are
                all top tier. It will
                make you see dreams and reality
                differently.

                If you want to know how Mark started with Facebook then this is the movie for you. It
                shows you how this man
                thought as a young man and the things he went and put other people through to build this billion dollar
                company.

                THE HUMOUR IN THESE MOVIES WAS AHEAD OF ITS TIME. I would rewatch them as many times
                as possible. A
                different, but needed, approach to fairy tale stories. If you haven't watched them then what are you
                doing
                with your life.

            <p class="description">
                Great storyline, amazing special effects and some cool ass cars. Ahead of its time
                for real. My children's
                children are definitely going to watch this.

            <p class="description">
                Marvel really created something beautiful here. I still have moments where I wish I
                was bitten by a
                radioactive spider and turned into your favourite neighbourhood spider. The original trilogy will
                forever be
                the best, but the animated spiderverse edition is a close second. Spiderman is not just for kids!!

            <p class="description">
                Your modern version of the Rocky movies. Extremely amazing. A great combination of
                actors. Makes you want to
                start boxing lol.

            <h3 class="titles">Fatherhood</h3>
            <p class="description">
                Very emotional movie about a man who had to raise his daughter on his own because his
                wife didn't make it
                after giving birth. So emotional that it's one of the only movies that made me cry. It is a must watch
                for
                sure.

            <p class="description">
                Best superheroe team(after the Justice League of course). The detail in each movie is
                amazing, all of them
                connected leading up to an amazing end to an era. Thanos is by far the most logical villain ever,
                diabolical
                but with valid reasoning.But in order to really understand the series you would have to watch individual
                movies based on the members of the avengers.<br />
